# ENGE1215 Assignment: D6. Data Visualization and Modeling

Data visualization is critically important in developing effective engineering solutions. The quantitative nature of data enables a systemic approach to problems. "D6. Data Visualization and Modeling Project" provides data of CO2 emission, population, and GDP for different countries over many years. By modeling the data provided, our team created a visual of potential relationships. This makes finding positive/negative/no correlations easy. The 14 grand challenges of engineering all require vast amounts of data. Without modeling this data, it is overwhelming and near-impossible to synthesize sound conclusions. Grand challenge 13 is on developing carbon sequestration methods. Man-made CO2 is not entirely bad, thus calculating the amount of emission a person produces on average, it is possible to one day limit this green-house gas. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and research purposes.

### Prerequisites

Software requirements include Matlab and Excel. The code was ran in a Windows 10 Pro environment on Matlab R2018B and Excel version 1906.

### Installing the files

[Download](https://github.com/rongtianyue/ENGE1215-D6/archive/master.zip) the data visualization code and data

or

```
git clone git://github.com/rongtianyue/ENGE1215-D6.git
```

to get the required files. Extract into your matlabs directory.
